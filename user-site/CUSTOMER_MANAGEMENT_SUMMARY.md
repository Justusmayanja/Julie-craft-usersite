# 🔧 Customer Management Issues - RESOLVED

## 📋 Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Profile Creation Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Users could sign up but corresponding records in the `profiles` table were not created.

**Root Cause**: The registration API only created records in the `users` table, ignoring the `profiles` table.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated `app/api/auth/register/route.ts` to create both `users` and `profiles` records
- Added automatic profile creation with proper field mapping
- Created database trigger to automatically create profiles when users are created

### 2. **Cart Isolation Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: All users seemed to access the same cart items.

**Root Cause**: The session manager wasn't properly integrated with the authentication system, and cart data wasn't properly isolated by user ID.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Integrated session manager with auth context
- Updated cart system to use proper user ID isolation
- Added cart migration functionality for guest users
- Created cart migration API endpoint

### 3. **Data Persistence Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Profile information was not stored in the database, making it unavailable after logout.

**Root Cause**: The authentication system wasn't fetching and storing profile data from the `profiles` table.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Updated login and verify APIs to fetch data from both `users` and `profiles` tables
- Created profile management API endpoint
- Added data synchronization between `users` and `profiles` tables
- Implemented proper data persistence across sessions

## 🔄 Data Flow Improvements

### Before (Broken Flow)
```
User Registration → users table only → No profile data → Cart not isolated
User Login → users table only → No profile persistence → Shared cart data
```

### After (Fixed Flow)
```
User Registration → users + profiles tables → Complete profile data → Isolated cart
User Login → users + profiles tables → Persistent profile data → User-specific cart
Guest Cart → Migration on login → Preserved cart data → Proper isolation
```

## 🗄️ Database Schema Updates

### New Tables Created
- ✅ `users` table (if not exists)
- ✅ `profiles` table (if not exists) 
- ✅ `user_carts` table (if not exists)

### Triggers Created
- ✅ `trigger_create_user_profile` - Auto-creates profile on user registration
- ✅ `trigger_sync_user_profile` - Syncs user data with profile data

### Functions Created
- ✅ `create_user_profile()` - Creates profile with proper field mapping
- ✅ `sync_user_profile()` - Keeps user and profile data in sync
- ✅ `cleanup_orphaned_carts()` - Cleans up old guest carts

### Security Policies
- ✅ Row Level Security enabled on all user tables
- ✅ Users can only access their own data
- ✅ Proper authentication checks for all operations

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ User registration creates both users and profiles records
- ✅ Login fetches complete user data from both tables
- ✅ Cart isolation works properly between users
- ✅ Guest cart migration works on login/registration
- ✅ Profile data persists across sessions
- ✅ Session management works correctly

### Test Documentation
- ✅ `TEST_USER_FLOW.md` - Comprehensive testing guide
- ✅ Step-by-step test scenarios
- ✅ Expected results and debugging tips
- ✅ Database queries for verification

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
